# Nitrogen flux modeling of coffee crops with Machine Learning


## Unsupervised Machine Learning models of nitrogen flux in coffee growing systems.

* Principal Component Analysis: unsupervised Machine Learning model.
* Discriminant analysis: unsupervised Machine Learning model.
* Linear Models with different residual covariance structures: (homogeneous variances and heterogeneous variances) selecting the most appropriate model according to the AIC and BIC information criteria.
