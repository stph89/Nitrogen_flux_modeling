# Nitrogen flux modeling of coffee crops with Machine Learning


## Unsupervised Machine Learning models of nitrogen flux in coffee growing systems.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA**: unsupervised Machine Learning model.
* **Discriminant analysis (DA)**: unsupervised Machine Learning model.
* **Linear Models with different residual covariance structures**: Homogeneous and heterogeneous variances analysis, selecting the most appropriate model according to the *AIC* and *BIC* information criteria.
